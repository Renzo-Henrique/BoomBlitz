BoomBlitz is an exciting game where you need to explore a maze full of challenges and dangers. Your mission is to collect keys and avoid enemies. The game is based on a two-dimensional canvas that represents the maze.

## Why we made BoomBlitz?
**BoomBlitz** is a project created by Computer Science students from UFES Vitória for the Integrated Project course of 2023/1, taught by [Joao Paulo Andrade Almeida](https://nemo.inf.ufes.br/equipe/jpalmeida/).
It takes inspiration from the game Bomberman and the desire to experience a game from the developer's perspective.
